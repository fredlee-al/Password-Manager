## Features

- **Secure Storage**: Your credentials are stored securely using encryption.
- **Easy to Use**: Simple prompts for site name, username, and password.
- **Local Storage**: All data is stored locally on your machine, giving you full control over your information.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Usage

Contributions are welcome! Please open an issue or submit a pull request if you'd like to contribute. This is a very minimalistic app, built solely for functionality. It’s not flashy like proprietary password managers out there—just a fun project created purely out of boredom.
